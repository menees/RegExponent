RegExponent is a .NET regular expression tester for Windows written in WPF. It's inspired by a few other regex testers I've used over the years:

* http://regexhero.net/ - An old Silverlight app that supported web browser (IE) and desktop use.
* http://regexstorm.net/tester - A modern browser-only tester.

I wanted a modern Windows app that had all the features I used from Regex Hero and with a UI more streamlined for how I work.
